```javascript
import { BrowserRouter, Routes, Route } from 'react-router-dom';

function App() {
  return (
    <BrowserRouter>
      <Routes>
        <Route path="/" element={<Home />} />
        <Route path="/about" element={<About />} />
        <Route path="/:path*" element={<NotFound />} />
      </Routes>
    </BrowserRouter>
  );
}

export default App;
```
This solution uses a more specific wildcard path, `/path*`, for improved route control. This approach allows for more fine-grained error handling while still ensuring that any unexpected paths are caught by the `NotFound` component.  It prevents other legitimate paths from being incorrectly caught by the wildcard path.

Additional debugging steps can include:

* **Console Logging:** Add console logs to track the actual paths being accessed by the router.
* **Route Debugging Tools:** Utilize browser developer tools or React Router debugging extensions for better insights into the routing process. 
* **Breaking Down Routes:** Deconstruct your routes into smaller, more manageable components to isolate and fix issues more easily.
