# React Router Dom Wildcard Path Issue

This repository demonstrates a potential bug in React Router Dom related to wildcard paths (`*`). The issue occurs when the wildcard path unintentionally catches routes that should be handled differently.  This can lead to unexpected behavior and make debugging difficult.

## Bug Description

The provided code uses a wildcard path (`*`) in the `Route` component to render a `NotFound` component for any unmatched routes. While this is generally useful for handling 404 errors, it can mask more specific routing issues.  Incorrectly configured routes or typos in path names may result in unexpected navigation to the `NotFound` component, hindering the identification of the actual problem.

## Solution

The solution involves carefully reviewing your route configuration, ensuring correct path names, and using more specific routes when appropriate.  Instead of relying solely on a broad wildcard, consider using more specific routes for handling errors, or using a combination of wildcard and specific routes for better error handling and better debugging experience.
