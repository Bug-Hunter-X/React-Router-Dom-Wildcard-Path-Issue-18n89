```javascript
import { BrowserRouter, Routes, Route } from 'react-router-dom';

function App() {
  return (
    <BrowserRouter>
      <Routes>
        <Route path="/" element={<Home />} />
        <Route path="/about" element={<About />} />
        <Route path="*" element={<NotFound />} />
      </Routes>
    </BrowserRouter>
  );
}

export default App;
```
This code has a potential bug: If the user navigates to a path that is not defined in the Routes component (e.g., `/invalid-path`), it will show the NotFound component. This is expected behavior, however, if there are other issues with routing such as misconfiguration or incorrect paths, it is difficult to debug.

The issue is that the `*` wildcard path in the `Route` component is too broad and can catch unintended paths.
